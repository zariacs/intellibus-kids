# Introduction
- The nutriLab app aims to address the long wait times and inefficiencies in getting personalized meal plans for conditions like Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), especially for those with triggers like gluten. By leveraging AI to generate initial meal plans and involving doctors for verification, it seeks to speed up the process, making it more accessible and efficient. This response outlines a Product Requirement Document (PRD) for nutriLab, ensuring it meets your personal experience and hackathon theme of "Broken experiences.

# Product Vision and Problem Statement
nutriLab's vision is to revolutionize dietary management for IBS patients by reducing wait times, which can currently take up to six months through traditional gastroenterologist and dietitian visits. 

Your story highlights the frustration of waiting two months for a gastroenterologist, with the process exacerbated by insurance issues and potential life-threatening delays. 

nutriLab aims to bridge this gap by using AI to generate preliminary meal plans, verified by doctors, to ensure faster, safer outcomes.

## Vision
- nutriLab aims to revolutionize dietary management for IBS patients by leveraging AI to generate initial meal plans, verified by doctors, to significantly reduce wait times and improve access to critical dietary advice.

## Mission
- To provide efficient, accurate, and personalized meal plans, ensuring timely and effective management for patients like yourself, addressing the broken experience of long waits and inaccessible care.

# Target Audience
- Patients: Individuals with IBS or similar conditions needing dietary management, focusing on those facing long wait times and insurance barriers, as you mentioned most doctors don't take insurance.

- Doctors: Gastroenterologists, dietitians, and other healthcare professionals with expertise in dietary management, who will review and approve meal plans, ensuring accuracy and safety.


# Key Features and User Roles
The app will serve two main user groups:
Patients: Can sign up, input medical history, receive and track meal plans, and request updates based on changing conditions.

Doctors: Review and approve AI-generated meal plans, verify patient data, and provide feedback to improve AI accuracy.

The AI agent, named Nevin (your personal nutrition assistant), will process patient data to create meal plans based on nutritional science, custom patient data and get feedback from doctors continuous improvement on what the patients should get.

# Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
Functionally, the app needs secure authentication, patient data management, AI meal plan generation, doctor review processes, notifications, and reporting features.

Non-functionally, it must comply with regulations like HIPAA for data security, ensure performance for growing user bases, and offer a user-friendly interface.

# Success Metrics and Development Priorities
Success will be measured by reduced wait times, meal plan accuracy, user satisfaction, and active user numbers. Development should prioritize core functionalities like user authentication and AI integration, ensuring security and usability from the start.

# Key Features
The app is divided into portals for patients and doctors, with the AI agent, Nevin, acting as a backend processor. Below is a detailed breakdown:

## Patient Portal Features
Sign-up and Profile Management: Secure registration with personal and medical history input.

Medical History Input: Patients can enter symptoms, triggers (e.g., gluten), and other relevant data, crucial for personalized plans.

Receive and View Meal Plans: Access approved meal plans, ensuring they align with dietary needs like low FODMAP, as per IBS Diet: FODMAP, What to Eat, What to Avoid, and More.

Symptom and Food Intake Tracking: Patients can log symptoms and foods consumed to identify personal triggers, supporting long-term management, especially given the need for reintroduction phases in restrictive diets.

Request Updates: Ability to update profiles and request new meal plans if conditions change, addressing dynamic health needs.

Doctor Portal Features
Sign-up and Profile Management: Secure access for healthcare professionals.

Review and Approve Meal Plans: Doctors verify AI-generated plans, ensuring accuracy, especially for complex cases like gluten-triggered IBS, and can modify as needed.

Verify Patient Data: Doctors can correct or confirm patient-entered information, reducing errors, given the sensitivity of medical data.

Provide Feedback: Doctors can rate or comment on AI recommendations, feeding into machine learning for improvement, a critical aspect for human-in-the-loop systems.

Communication Option: Optional messaging with patients for clarification, enhancing collaboration.

Analytics and Reports: View and download reports on patient outcomes and AI performance, aiding in continuous improvement and compliance.

# AI Agent (Nevin) Functionality
Meal Plan Generation: Processes patient data using nutritional science and clinical guidelines.
