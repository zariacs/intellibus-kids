Based on your request, here is the file structure for the AI folder, which will serve as a separate FastAPI application dedicated solely to handling AI integration, including the Large Language Model (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. This service will be deployed to Render. The structure is designed to be modular, maintainable, and focused exclusively on AI-related operations.

Description of Key Files and Directories
main.py
The entry point for the FastAPI application. This file initializes the FastAPI app, defines API routes, and handles incoming requests for AI-related tasks, such as generating responses or processing queries using the LLM and RAG pipeline.
requirements.txt
Lists all Python dependencies required for the AI service, such as fastapi, langchain, pinecone-client, and other libraries essential for AI integration.
.env
Stores environment variables, including API keys for external services (e.g., OpenAI, Pinecone), model configurations, and other sensitive data, ensuring secure management of credentials.
Dockerfile
Contains instructions to build a Docker image for the AI service, enabling consistent deployment to Render.
config/settings.py
Holds configuration settings for the AI service, such as model parameters, API endpoints, and other constants used throughout the application.
models/llm.py
Contains the logic for integrating and interacting with the Large Language Model (LLM), managing tasks like loading the model and generating responses.
models/rag.py
Implements the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, combining retrieval from a knowledge base with generation using the LLM.
services/ai_service.py
Encapsulates the core business logic for AI operations, coordinating interactions between the LLM, RAG pipeline, and incoming requests.
utils/helpers.py
Provides utility functions to support the AI service, such as data preprocessing and response formatting.
tests/
Includes test suites to ensure the AI service functions correctly:  
test_llm.py: Tests for LLM integration.  
test_rag.py: Tests for the RAG pipeline.
This structure ensures the AI service is a standalone FastAPI application focused solely on AI integration, ready for deployment to Render, and easy to maintain. Let me know if you need further clarification!
