      When creating specification files:

      1. Always place spec files in PROJECT_ROOT/.spec/:
         ```
         .spec/
         ├── project_specs.md
         ├── development_roles.md
         ├── api_specs/
         │   ├── gemini_api.md
         │   └── ...
         └── ...
         ```

      2. Follow the naming convention:
         - Use snake_case for filenames
         - Use descriptive names that reflect the spec's purpose
         - Group related specs in subdirectories

      3. Directory structure:
         ```
         PROJECT_ROOT/
         ├── .spec/
         │   ├── general_specs.md
         │   ├── development_roles.md
         │   ├── api_specs/
         │   │   └── ...
         │   └── ...
         └── ...
         ```

      4. Never place spec files:
         - In the project root (except the .spec directory itself)
         - Mixed with implementation code
         - In any location outside the .spec directory

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Spec file in wrong location
      specs/api_spec.md
      my_feature.spec.md
      
      # Good: Spec file in correct location
      .spec/api_spec.md
      .spec/api/gemini_integration.md
    output: "Correctly placed specification file"
