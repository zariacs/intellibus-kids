# No Sanitize Message Rule

Rule to prevent including sanitize_message function in scripts unless explicitly requested.

<rule>
name: no_sanitize_message
description: Prevent including sanitize_message function in Python files
filters:
  # Match Python files
  - type: file_extension
    pattern: "\\.py$"
  # Match file creation or modification events
  - type: event
    pattern: "file_(create|modify)"

actions:
  - type: warn
    conditions:
      - pattern: "def _?sanitize_messages?\\("
        message: "Avoid including sanitize_message function in scripts. This functionality should be handled separately."

  - type: suggest
    message: |
      The sanitize_message function should not be included in scripts by default.
      If you need message sanitization functionality:
      
      1. Create a dedicated utility module for this purpose
      2. Make an explicit request to include it in your script

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Including sanitize_message function
      def sanitize_message(messages):
          # Function implementation
          pass
          
      def _sanitize_messages(messages):
          # Function implementation
          pass
      
      # Good: No sanitize_message function
      def process_messages(messages):
          # Function implementation
          pass
    output: "Code without sanitize_message function"
