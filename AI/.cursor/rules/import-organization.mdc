# Import Organization

## Description
Organize imports into three distinct sections in the following order:
1. Built-in imports (Python standard library)
2. Third-party imports (installed packages)
3. Local imports (from your own codebase)

Each section should be separated by a blank line.

## Examples

### Incorrect
```python
from AI.config.settings import config
import os
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Union, Any
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from pathlib import Path
```

### Correct
```python
# Built-in imports
import os
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Union, Any

# Third-party imports
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI

# Local imports
from AI.config.settings import config
```

## Why
- Improves code readability and organization
- Makes dependencies clear at a glance
- Follows Python PEP 8 style guide recommendations
- Helps prevent circular import issues
- Makes it easier to identify potential import conflicts

## How To Fix
1. Group all built-in Python standard library imports at the top
2. Add a blank line, then add all third-party package imports
3. Add another blank line, then add all local project imports
4. Within each group, consider alphabetical ordering for consistency
